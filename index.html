  <h3>Structure of A Story</h3>
  <p> If you ask a child, <q>What's the order of a good story?</q> they'll respond with <q>Oh, that's easy, there's a beginning, a middle and an end.</q>
      If you ask a script writer the same question they might respond and say there are six parts: <blockquote cite=""><p> the set up, catalyst, first turning point, climax,
        final confrontation and resolution.</blockquote></p>
  <p>Every answer will differ from person to person, therefore all a leader needs is a simple structure that works. Everyone is a natural-born storyteller,
  since we grew up listening to bedtime stories, which helped us to know what's a good structure for a story.</p>
